Just a day or so after managing to break my 109-day-code-streak at the LearnVerified program of Flatiron School, I have been spending a lot of time pondering the value of the code streak.

### What Is A Code Streak?

For those of you who may have never heard of the term 'codestreak', a general definition of a codestreak is the number of consecutive days on which youâ€™ve spent time coding or learning to code. In my case, it was the consecutive number of days that I spent time learning to code in the LearnVerified platform.

##  So Many Coding Platforms, So Little Time

I have spent all of 2016 devoting my freetime to learning to code. Actively learning to code was a 2016 New Year's resolution I made to myself this year. And for all practical purposes, I can essentially guarantee that I have spent some time each and every day in the pursuit of learning to code.

Whether it has been reading actual books on various coding languages; spending time going through lessons on different online platforms such as [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com), [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) or [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com); enrolling in several Blueprints at [Skillcrush](http://skillcrush.com); completing courses and tutorials on [Udemy](http://udemy.com), [Skillshare](http://skillshare.com) and [Udacity](http://udacity); using the [SoloLearn apps](http://sololearn.com) on my phone while waiting for a table at a restaurant or in between pet sits each day when I am away from my computer and just NEED some coding time; and eventually enrolling in the online program at [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com). I can honestly say I am addicted to learning to code!!

### Code Challenges

About a month into being enrolled at LearnVerified, I came across the #codestreak hashtag on Twitter, at which time I was already 35 days into working on lessons on the Learn platform. And then shortly there after, I ran across the #100daysofcode hashtag (41 days into my #codestreak) and coding challenge. How could I not start participating?!?! I was almost halfway there!!

> Research has shown that it takes 31 days of conscious effort to make or break a habit. That means, if one practices something consistently for 31 days, on the 32nd day it does become a habit. Information has been internalised into behavioural change, which is called transformation. - Shiv Khera

At first I wasn't sure I could keep it up because I am not very good at keeping track of things...thankfully, Flatiron actually made that pretty darn easy with their built in current learning streak feature of the student dashboard! All I had to do was just keep on, keeping on!

Keep on learning to code, which I was doing anyway...except now I was striving to make sure I did it for 100 days. Which actually should not have been such a big deal since from January 1st til the first day I tweeted the hashtag of #100daysofcode on June 27th, according to an online date calculator:

> The total number of days between Friday, January 1st, 2016 and Monday, June 27th, 2016 is 178 days.

One hundred seventy-eight days is equal to 5 months and 26 days... 100 days should be a piece of cake!! Yet the closer I got to the hundred day mark, the more worried I got. Would I blow it days or even a day before the 100 days??

## 100 Day Accomplishments

I feel like these last 109 days (not to mention the 178 days before that) I have learned so much!! Not only have I managed to get through roughly 100 lessons of the LearnVerified program (82 lessons in the Fullstack Web Development track and 25 lessons in the new Intro to Javascript track).

##I have also managed to:

*  build a number of Ruby on Rails app (the first of which was a Pinterest-clone which I am kinda fond of!) from various Udemy classes and Youtube tutorials
*  worked my way through and earned my certificates for the HTML Fundamentals, CSS Fundamentals and SQL Fundementals of the SoloLearn apps
*  finished the Tribute Page challenge at FreeCodeCamp
*  have found so many more (more than one can possibly get through in a life time!!) tutorials, lessons and coding resources that I just need to find enough time in the day to work my way through!!
* And yes, I have learned a lot about coding...but I have also made learning to code a habit. Coding is a part of my everyday life now. I look forward to getting time to code each day...it is actually a bit of a problem...it is a total addiction!

Now, after a long day of work or errands or just everyday chores, I find myself *jonesing* for just a little coding time!!  Just one little lesson on Learn or a quick fix of Treehouse if time is short or even having to wait for a table at a restaurant isn't so bad cause I can work through a few questions on a SoloLearn app! I need my coding time!!

Although I 'technically' broke my codestreak, as in it is back to 2-days at the moment, I spent that particular day making my Sinatra Fwitter project look pretty (working on the CSS) as a break from my frustration at trying to get all the specs to pass.

So although my codestreak has reset itself at LearnVerified...my **Year of Learning to Code** is still safe...and continues....  :-)
